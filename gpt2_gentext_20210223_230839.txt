In the Great State of Texas, where I just left for a two day trip to work, we have had to cancel some of the events because of the extreme cold and other problems. But, as the saying goes, “if it bleeds, it leads.”

No Cumming Vote!

The Democrats are trying to abolish the Power of the Prong in the Great State of Texas. I wonder if they can find a doctor to do the job?

Bill Clinton called me George yesterday. He thought I was crazy. The fact is that Hillary hates him now, and may very well hate him after the election is over. Many things I said then were lies, and the Clinton camp knew them. Politically correct fools!
Watched low rated @Morning_Joe for first time in long time. FAKE NEWS. He can't believe the Democrat Clowns are raking in so much money. I'm putting them to work now. Job

 (Photo credit should read JAKE BOWIE/AFP/Getty Images) Protesters surround President Obama at the DNC. He looks dazed and unsteady. Is he dehydrated? If he is, he is not fit to lead our country! If he is, we have plenty of people to choose from! Thank you!
....The Fake News is really going crazy with those accusations & lies. They don’t even try to get the truth. They are sick losers with very

 - Congress must pass tough immigration laws now. The gangs and MS-13 thugs are not going anywhere. Law enforcement has to get tough. Congress must also provide a path to citizenship.
The United States does not need another four more years of the Corrupt Impeachment Hoax. The Fake News Media is just as bad as the Corrupt Stephen Bannon!
The Democrats are spending a fortune on their Dem National Ads, which are a total BUST. They are spending less than one percent
====================
Women and Girls' Suffrage
The Democrats are working overtime to make life for women in this country as difficult as possible. They are holding the labor markets of our country hostage, throwing millions of American women into the unemployment ditch. The Republicans would do a great job!
The Democrats are holding our wages hostage. They want to take Social Security away from workers, Pensions and Medicare. Republicans would do a great job!
The Democrats are OBSTRUCTING the votes of Republican Senators who are working

How can you be angry at Republicans when you had the audacity to release (after I released the Transcripts) the long awaited Transcripts of the Draft Ruling Conference call with the Ukrainian President?

Fake News is reporting that I am talking to (fill in the blank) Mark Burnett about doing a big show at the White House Christmas Tree Lighting. This is not true, never had a chance.

The Democrats are just in time. They are trying to take Care of Business
====================
....The problem with this Michael Bloomberg ad is that it is almost RINO in the Tea Party, almost Trump. This is a Karl Rove commercial, just like his other failed ads. Karl Rove tried to bring me to the Senate, and now he brings me almost RINO. I said “no”, and he tried to bring me to the Senate, but I said “no” much bigger. This is another fake ad, just like “Super Tuesday”.
====================
We did not get the votes in the House of Representatives to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in history, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Bill. Instead, we got nothing but Repeal & Replace, which is what we have done since the middle of last year. The Senate should get this done for the American people, or get no part of the Tax Cuts. A winner for Schumer and Pelosi, losers for the Republicans. Merry Christmas to all!
The United States Chamber of Commerce,

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Bernie or bust Sanders wing of the party are still fighting over Bernie. The people are furious at them both. They are the real criminals. They stole the Sanders Caucus. Now they want to take it back. Don’t let them!

I never said Russia took over Crimea. This story is FAKE NEWS. The Sanders/Russia story is a hoax and the DNC is even worse. Great disrespect!

The Bernie or

The new Hollywood Reporter film, about me and my life, is FAKE NEWS. It is written in the style of a teenage boy scout magazine. The story is made up and based on a phony book by unknown writer(s).

The H-1B Visa is a Program designed to help agriculture, but has the unintended consequence of greatly reducing the number of H-1B workers. We must immediately end this ridiculous Visa Program and return our agriculture to its previous levels of production!

“Did any FBI agent (who worked on the Clinton Dossier probe) ever tell the Senate Judiciary Committee, “You can’t get anything done in Washington, D.C., unless I agree to a Take Out, Take Out, Take Out, Take Out,”?
FBI Agent Peter S was a source of great embarrassment to the Obama Justice Department and to me, and yet the Fake News Media refuses to report this betrayal. Thank you!
So it turns out
====================
Is the Fake News going to say that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous) when they colluded in the 2016 Election (so Dem coordinated) and then tried to hide it so that Crooked Hillary would not get elected? A total Witch Hunt!

Why didn’t the FBI take the Server from the DNC? They have a great chance to get it back now. Rigged and badly damaged cases against Clinton are a joke. Lynch met his wife there. Sally
====================
.@CNN just cannot get any of their primetime speakers to talk about what a crooked deal Hillary Clinton was making in her dealings with Russia. Instead they go for the cheap shot, mocking her as though she is an out of control loose cannon. Just like they did to me.
The Democrats have been trying to distance themselves from Chelsea for a long time. Now they are saying that she is taking too many commercials.
The Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open

President Obama is dangerously weak & ineffective. He doesn’t have a clue. We are winning because he is helping our country win, and I am helping our country win!

The Fake News is trying so hard to paint a picture of Melania as nothing more than a pretty face. Wrong, she is a pretty face because she got the job, paid the rent, paid the mortgage & got the car. Ivana Trump didn’t do it, Barron Trump didn’

The Washington Post has apologized for a false story about Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). Read apology.

The White House Correspondents Dinner was a huge, beautiful success last year, but this year was even bigger, with thousands of journalists and speakers from all over the world. This year was supposed to be a big year for Trump friends and foes alike, but sadly, it was a bust. So sad!

The main question on everyone's mind this weekend is �

For the last decade, Democrats and their Committees and the people in Congress have done NOTHING to stop the bleeding in Syria. Now they are doing “painful” things to Syrian children, many of whom are already wounded.

The Republican Party has NEVER been so united! This, despite phony Witch Hunts, Memos, and a fabricated Russian Collusion Hoax. They fought so hard against me and my administration, and fought even harder against the Great Red Wave that I unleashed on Alabama.

At least eight people have been killed and dozens wounded in a gun attack in central London. The Mayor of London has been warned to be careful. This is not the type of country we want. The police are not doing their job. The Government is not doing its job.
The European Union is concerned that the United States is letting the world know that it is OK to kill people, including our soldiers, with guns. We must be careful. The terrorists are soo harmless, even cute!
====================
On November 3rd, the Republican Party will elect a new Congress, and for the first time in over a decade, we will have a real chance of controlling the Senate. The Senate is totally controlled by the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, and our vote on legislation is a meaningless gesture. For them to take the lead on healthcare, Infrastructure, Gun Safety, Prescription Drug Prices, and all other matters, we must give them the votes they need.

The Republican Party (and me) got scammed yesterday when I opened up the nominations process for Federal Records. You are entitled to see the complete Transcripts. There is nothing to see. Release to the public without restriction. Save the Whistleblowers and the missing documents.

Watch CNN TONIGHT @10:00 A.M. For the first time in a long time, the Fake News Networks are reporting that China is taking advantage of the U.S. in our trade negotiations.

I had a very good meeting with NATO. Nothing was off the table. Perhaps I will be needing NATO allies in the future. This was a poorly attended meeting, perhaps more poorly attended than any NATO meeting in many years.

A total mess in Puerto Rico. Congress to decide how to spend $4.5 billion. Big Lies by the Democrats (using a hoax as their decoy). Congress to get back to work.

Wow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort,

In a statement released yesterday, the Russian government condemned the United States for its interference in the U.S. Presidential Election. That was the end of the story. But the Fake News knew that was not true, and they just kept digging. Corrupt Media, they’re in for a big ‘win’!

The Monmouth Poll was only taken before the Election, and we are only beginning to see the results. The Conservative Media &

I want to thank all of my awesome news organizations that covered the TPP and the Impeachment Hoax (Fake News) better than any of the Depleted News Departments. Also, big Tech giants like Amazon and Google. The Radical Left doesn’t want these agreements to go into effect so they are working hard to kill them. I won’t let it happen.

Thank you to David, and all others, for your great honesty and strong reporting on the TPP

A crowd gathered at the steps of the Supreme Court, where Justice Neil Gorsuch tried to read a statement from his courtroom, but was unable to do so. He almost certainly meant his statement from the bench, not from the lectern.
 
The only thing keeping the Dems from passing landmark legislation is what they are working on now, such as a National Guard State, which they will eventually have to admit is necessary.
I am fighting for the American Worker, not the American Worker State!

In a statement released late last night, Mumia Abu-Jamal called the Boston Bombing a hoax and said that the police were paid off by the fake investigators!

So now the Radical Left Democrats, who would have nothing to do with Bombing a marathon in order to hurt the USA, are complaining about the way that two police officers were treated last night in Boston. A hoax, of course, but that's what we are dealing with.

Hillary Clinton's Emails are the worst!!!

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to shut down our country. If she can't do it herself, she should at least help her husband out a little bit. Perhaps that'll do it!

Hillary Clinton is very dishonest. Her statement after the election, 'I did not do it because I want to, I did it because I have to'
====================
The Magnitsky Act, which passed the House of Representatives unanimously on Thursday, is the greatest political crime in American history. It is a Treasury Act, not a Judiciary Act. It is a Criminal Act, not a Law Enforcement Act. It is a Trojan Horse, not a good idea. Read the Transcripts. Hillary Clinton is a criminal.

A look at the Senate races that were won by Bernie Sanders haters (and others):

1. Tammy Baldwin, the former first lady of Alabama, is a failed RINO who gave up on her quest to be governor & has become a Nancy Pelosi puppet. See her commercials where she looks nothing like her wife. Tammy lies like a dog, cries like a baby, and is bad for our Military and our great Vets. People forget she was for NAFTA, Crime Bill, Open
====================
The Republicans are going to lose a lot of House seats because of their very weak and ineffective HealthCare bill, which worships in the House and doesn't do much good. Sad!

Nothing was done, they screamed, and nothing was done about the threat. The Obama Administration gave Iran almost 90 billion dollars in aid, and nothing was done to help Israel defend itself. This was a total double standard and a laughing stock all over the world. The pro-Iran protesters were young, angry and without cause. The Obama

Very simple. Bill protects our Country.

Re Super Predator Michelle, stop with the Fake Dossier! 

This is a great and well reseached book on Criminal Justice. Michelle Alexander is a tough cookie who is sick of getting taken apart for having a good point. Her book is far superior to the grossly inaccurate Dossier. I thought the Dossier was a Trojan Horse for Crooked Hillary. Michelle should read her book.

After more than two years of vicious partisan warfare, the Democrats are exhausted. They are getting nothing done, & have lost their ability to lead. The Republicans are getting great things done, even major milestones, but the Dems are getting nothing done, & have lost their minds!

This story is so false and so bad for our Country, and for our Global Competitiveness, that we can barely find a positive spin. We are sending a big delegation to China, and they are trying to determine if they can enter our country — legal and illegal. They failed on the border, and failed on everything else, so now they are trying to enter our Country. How stupid and deceitful!

Drafted in 2008, the controversial Kavanaugh nomination has since been heavily scrutinized, voted down, and is now being brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The reason for this is that Democrats want to take the nomination AWAY from the Supreme Court and do future Kavanaugh hearings in secret. This is a terrible idea, and one which I would ultimately vote for, NO!
Just another bad day for Democrat Senate candidates. Bob Menendez was a TOTAL BUST, a total fraud who has been a total

Greetings Citizens and Civilians, You are about to witness one of the best weeks of your life. The Trump Administration is doing such a great job, and we are only getting better.

Expect great things. Keep fighting ICE and the FBI!

Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s District in California went for the taking on Election Day. The only problem is that she didn’t want to concede, despite the fact that she had gone down by more than 20 points in the polls, and the Republicans had jumped in to take her.

Media outlets are putting a premium on the fact that Nancy Pelosi is angry that she didn’t get her husband, Joe Biden, elected in 2008.

Memos just released by the FBI and CIA prove that the so-called “Russia Hoax” was a scam that was paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC.

Crazy Nancy Pelosi is upset that I said she should use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender on her birth certificate. This is not about me, it is about the Democrats, and the fact that I corrected her horribly stated desire to use the women's restroom. I should have said corresponded to the women's restroom, not birth certificate. Very disloyal to Bill!
The Democrat Party has given up on counting votes in Iowa. Looks like it all got computer “fried”.

MIAMI — Senator Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in over 20 years, and Hillary is strong on illegal immigration. Marco can only become President if he makes a deal with the Democrats on illegal immigration.

I will unify the Republican Party behind one candidate, Donald J. Trump. I want to thank my fantastic running mate, @LindseyGrahamSC. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

BALTIMORE, Maryland — The Presidential Twitter Account was setup to look like the Fake News is now finding out how to work. The Fake Suppression Polls were a big part of the Build-up. Witch Hunt!
So disgraceful what is happening in Baltimore. The Governor wants to close all of his City and State Police will not let him do his job. There is not a thing the Police can or will do to make the situation better! E.g. Lockdown of

The Radical Left Democrats are working overtime to blame RINO Mitt Romney for the terrible terrorist attack in London. They are only looking at one side (security) and ignoring the other (Riots, crime, and the USA itself being hit).They are a disgrace to our Nation and should pay a big price for what they have done to our country. Nevertheless, the USA is doing great!
Democrats ‘got caught spying on my campaign, and using that information to influence the 2016 Election.

One of the great ironies of American politics is that the Dems were so quick to embrace the Russia Hoax, even as they quietly dropped out of the investigation. But even when the Hoax dies, the Witch Hunt will go on, just like the Obama years

The new Mexico City policy is a disgrace. The Obama Administration was slow in processing the applications of asylum-seekers, some of whom have been waiting for years, and others of whom we now have confirmed applications from. To compound matters, they refused to say why they were so quickly rejecting applications. We now have hundreds of positive applications from countries that should have been approved, yet again!
We now have the absolute list of countries from which foreign fighters are coming into Mexico. The countries are not only
